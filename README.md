# Bakery Management System

## Overview
This is a console-based Bakery Management System built in Java.  
It helps manage bakery items, perform billing, and keep a record of all products.

## Features
- Add, display, search, update, and delete items  
- Automated unique ID for each item  
- Billing using item ID  
- Input validation for price and quantity  
- Data is saved in a file (bakery.txt)

## How It Works
1. The system is menu-driven, allowing users to choose operations

3. Users can perform CRUD operations and billing  
4. Data persists in a file for future use
